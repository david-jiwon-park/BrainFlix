# BrainFlix

BrainFlix is a school project where I created a mock video player website. This is the frontend code which was created using React.js. 

## Getting Started

To run this project, please first go to my brainflix-api repo and run the server for this website.

Then, run ```$ npm install``` here to get all dependencies and packages. 

#### Frontend .env.local

```.env.local.sample``` provides a sample of the local server. You will need to add the following local environment variable to your .env.local file:
`REACT_APP_SERVER`

#### Now you are all set!

Run ```$ npm start``` to start the project.
